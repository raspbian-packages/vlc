Embedded copy of ffmpeg
=======================

Until the release of vlc 3.0, vlc needs an embedded copy of ffmpeg 2.8.X. The
embedded copy is implemented using 3.0 (quilt)'s support for multiple orig
tarballs. When importing new upstream tarballs with gbp, do not forget to
specify ffmpeg as a component. For example, run

$ gbp import-orig ../vlc-2.2.X.tar.xz --component ffmpeg-2-8-Y

to import a vlc upstream tarball and ffmpeg as component.
