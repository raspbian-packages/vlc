Embedded copy of ffmpeg
=======================

Until the release of vlc 3.0, vlc needs an embedded copy of ffmpeg 2.8.X. The
embedded copy is implemented using 3.0 (quilt)'s support for multiple orig
tarballs. Since gbp does not play very well with them, you need to ensure that
you have vlc_2.2.2.orig-ffmpeg-2-8-6.tar.xz when building the package and have
it unpacked as ffmpeg-2-8-6.
